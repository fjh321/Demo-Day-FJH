The main premise of this demo day app is to simplify and faciliate inventory tracking for businesses and small business owners. Business owners have the ability to login into their account, add items, dictate the quantity of those items.

What I did to build this app:
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and EJS to code this project.

The main structure of the app involves the profile page where users can add items and those items' quantities. These items and corresponding quantities populate in the DOM as li elements and allow for the updating of the quantity via a PUT request on the server-side. 

Lessons Learned :
* Familiarized myself with API implementation and documentation.
* Developed a more profound understanding of CRUD applciations and database NoSQL databse implementation with MongoDB.
